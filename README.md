# Credit_card_fraud_detection
Introduction
This project aims to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm. The dataset used for training and testing contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)
pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. It is hosted on Kaggle and contains features such as time, amount, and various PCA transformed features due to privacy reasons.

Implementation
The implementation involves the following steps:
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of features, class imbalance, etc.
Feature engineering: Creating new features if necessary.
Model training: Using logistic regression for fraud detection.
Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters for better performance if necessary.

How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb to see the implementation step-by-step.
You can also directly use the trained model for prediction by loading it from the saved model file (logistic_regression_model.pkl).

Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set. The model's performance can be further improved by exploring other algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or using more advanced techniques such as anomaly detection.
